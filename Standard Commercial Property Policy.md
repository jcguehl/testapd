<!-- PageBreak -->

We will not pay for loss or damage:

## 4. Additional Coverages

a. Debris Removal

(1) Subject to Paragraphs (3) and (4), we
will pay your expense to remove debris
of Covered Property caused by or re-
sulting from a Covered Cause of Loss
that occurs during the policy period. The
expenses will be paid only if they are
reported to us in writing within 180 days
of the date of direct physical loss or
damage.

(2) Debris Removal does not apply to costs
to:

(a) Extract "pollutants" from land or
water; or

(b) Remove, restore or replace polluted
land or water.

(3) Subject to the exceptions in Paragraph
(4), the following provisions apply:

(a) The most we will pay for the total of
direct physical loss or damage plus
debris removal expense is the Limit
of Insurance applicable to the Cov-
ered Property that has sustained
loss or damage.

(b) Subject to (a) above, the amount we
will pay for debris removal expense
is limited to 25% of the sum of the
deductible plus the amount that we
pay for direct physical loss or dam-
age to the Covered Property that has
sustained loss or damage.

(4) We will pay up to an additional $10,000
for debris removal expense, for each lo-
cation, in any one occurrence of physi-
cal loss or damage to Covered Property,
if one or both of the following circums-
tances apply:

(a) The total of the actual debris removal
expense plus the amount we pay for
direct physical loss or damage ex-
ceeds the Limit of Insurance on the
Covered Property that has sustained
loss or damage.

(b) The actual debris removal expense
exceeds 25% of the sum of the de-
ductible plus the amount that we pay
for direct physical loss or damage to
the Covered Property that has sus-
tained loss or damage.

<!-- PageNumber="Page 4 of 17" -->
<!-- PageFooter="@ ISO Properties, Inc., 2007" -->
<!-- PageFooter="CP 00 99 06 07 ☐" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Therefore, if (4)(a) and/or (4)(b) apply, our
total payment for direct physical loss or
damage and debris removal expense may
reach but will never exceed the Limit of In-
surance on the Covered Property that has
sustained loss or damage, plus $10,000.


### (5) Examples

The following examples assume that
there is no Coinsurance penalty.


#### EXAMPLE #1


<table>
<tr>
<td>Limit of Insurance:</td>
<td>$ 90,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amount of Deductible:</td>
<td>$ 500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amount of Loss:</td>
<td>$ 50,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amount of Loss Payable:</td>
<td>$ 49,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>($50,000 - $500)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Debris Removal Expense:</td>
<td>$ 10,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Debris Removal Expense Payable:</td>
<td>$ 10,000</td>
</tr>
</table>


($10,000 is 20% of $50,000.)

The debris removal expense is less than 25% of the
sum of the loss payable plus the deductible. The sum
of the loss payable and the debris removal expense
($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) is less than the Limit
of Insurance. Therefore the full amount of debris
removal expense is payable in accordance with the
terms of Paragraph (3).


##### EXAMPLE #2


<table>
<tr>
<td>Limit of Insurance:</td>
<td>$ 90,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amount of Deductible:</td>
<td>$ 500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amount of Loss:</td>
<td>$ 80,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amount of Loss Payable:</td>
<td>$ 79,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">($80,000 - $500)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Debris Removal Expense:</td>
<td>$ 30,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Debris Removal Expense Payable</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Basic Amount:</td>
<td>$ 10,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Additional Amount:</td>
<td>$ 10,000</td>
</tr>
</table>


The basic amount payable for debris removal ex-
pense under the terms of Paragraph (3) is calculated
as follows: $80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = $20,000;
capped at $10,500. The cap applies because the sum
of the loss payable ($79,500) and the basic amount
payable for debris removal expense ($10,500) cannot
exceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000).

The additional amount payable for debris removal
expense is provided in accordance with the terms of
Paragraph (4), because the debris removal expense
($30,000) exceeds 25% of the loss payable plus the
deductible ($30,000 is 37.5% of $80,000), and be-
cause the sum of the loss payable and debris removal
expense ($79,500 + $30,000 = $109,500) would ex-
ceed the Limit of Insurance ($90,000). The additional
amount of covered debris removal expense is
$10,000, the maximum payable under Paragraph (4).
Thus the total payable for debris removal expense in
this example is $20,500; $9,500 of the debris removal
expense is not covered.


## b. Preservation Of Property

If it is necessary to move Covered Property
from the described premises to preserve it
from loss or damage by a Covered Cause
of Loss, we will pay for any direct physical
loss or damage to that property:

(1) While it is being moved or while tempo-
rarily stored at another location; and

(2) Only if the loss or damage occurs within
30 days after the property is first moved.


## c. Fire Department Service Charge

When the fire department is called to save
or protect Covered Property from a Cov-
ered Cause of Loss, we will pay up to
$1,000, unless a higher limit is shown in the
Declarations, for your liability for fire de-
partment service charges:

(1) Assumed by contract or agreement prior
to loss; or

(2) Required by local ordinance.

No Deductible applies to this Additional
Coverage.

d. Pollutant Clean-up And Removal

We will pay your expense to extract "pollu-
tants" from land or water at the described
premises if the discharge, dispersal, see-
page, migration, release or escape of the
"pollutants" is caused by or results from a
Covered Cause of Loss that occurs during
the policy period. The expenses will be paid
only if they are reported to us in writing
within 180 days of the date on which the
Covered Cause of Loss occurs.

<!-- PageFooter="CP 00 99 06 07" -->
<!-- PageFooter="@ ISO Properties, Inc., 2007" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Page 5 of 17 ☐" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

This Additional Coverage does not apply to
costs to test for, monitor or assess the exis-
tence, concentration or effects of "pollu-
tants". But we will pay for testing which is
performed in the course of extracting the
"pollutants" from the land or water.

The most we will pay under this Additional
Coverage for each described premises is
$10,000 for the sum of all covered ex-
penses arising out of Covered Causes of
Loss occurring during each separate 12-
month period of this policy.


## e. Electronic Data

(1) Under this Additional Coverage, elec-
tronic data has the meaning described
under Property Not Covered, Electronic
Data.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Addi-
tional Coverage, we will pay for the cost
to replace or restore electronic data
which has been destroyed or corrupted
by a Covered Cause of Loss. To the ex-
tent that electronic data is not replaced
or restored, the loss will be valued at the
cost of replacement of the media on
which the electronic data was stored,
with blank media of substantially iden-
tical type.

(3) The Covered Causes of Loss applicable
to Your Business Personal Property ap-
ply to this Additional Coverage, Elec-
tronic Data, subject to the following:

(a) If this Policy is endorsed to add a
Covered Cause of Loss, the addi-
tional Covered Cause of Loss does
not apply to the coverage provided
under this Additional Coverage,
Electronic Data.

(b) The Covered Causes of Loss include
a virus, harmful code or similar in-
struction introduced into or enacted
on a computer system (including
electronic data) or a network to
which it is connected, designed to
damage or destroy any part of the
system or disrupt its normal opera-
tion. But there is no coverage for
loss or damage caused by or result-
ing from manipulation of a computer
system (including electronic data) by
any employee, including a temporary
or leased employee, or by an entity
retained by you or for you to inspect,
design, install, modify, maintain, re-
pair or replace that system.

(4) The most we will pay under this Addi-
tional Coverage, Electronic Data, is
$2,500 for all loss or damage sustained
in any one policy year, regardless of the
number of occurrences of loss or dam-
age or the number of premises, loca-
tions or computer systems involved. If
loss payment on the first occurrence
does not exhaust this amount, then the
balance is available for subsequent loss
or damage sustained in but not after that
policy year. With respect to an occur-
rence which begins in one policy year
and continues or results in additional
loss or damage in a subsequent policy
year(s), all loss or damage is deemed to
be sustained in the policy year in which
the occurrence began.


## f. Limited Coverage For "Fungus", Wet Rot, Dry Rot And Bacteria

(1) The coverage described in f.(2) only
applies when the "fungus", wet or dry rot
or bacteria is the result of one or more
of the following causes that occurs dur-
ing the policy period and only if all rea-
sonable means were used to save and
preserve the property from further dam-
age at the time of and after that occur-
rence.

(a) A Covered Cause of Loss other than
fire or lightning; or

(b) Flood, if the Flood Coverage En-
dorsement applies to the affected
premises.

(2) We will pay for loss or damage by "fun-
gus", wet or dry rot or bacteria. As used
in this Limited Coverage, the term loss
or damage means:

(a) Direct physical loss or damage to
Covered Property caused by "fun-
gus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, in-
cluding the cost of removal of the
"fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria;

(b) The cost to tear out and replace any
part of the building or other property
as needed to gain access to the
"fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria;
and

(c) The cost of testing performed after
removal, repair, replacement or res-
toration of the damaged property is
completed, provided there is a rea-
son to believe that "fungus", wet or
dry rot or bacteria are present.

<!-- PageFooter="CP 00 99 06 07 ☐" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

(3) The coverage described under f.(2) of
this Limited Coverage is limited to
$15,000. Regardless of the number of
claims, this limit is the most we will pay
for the total of all loss or damage arising
out of all occurrences of Covered Caus-
es of Loss (other than fire or lightning)
and Flood which take place in a 12-
month period (starting with the begin-
ning of the present annual policy pe-
riod). With respect to a particular occur-
rence of loss which results in "fungus",
wet or dry rot or bacteria, we will not pay
more than a total of $15,000 even if the
"fungus", wet or dry rot or bacteria con-
tinues to be present or active, or recurs,
in a later policy period.

(4) The coverage provided under this Li-
mited Coverage does not increase the
applicable Limit of Insurance on any
Covered Property. If a particular occur-
rence results in loss or damage by "fun-
gus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, and oth-
er loss or damage, we will not pay more,
for the total of all loss or damage, than
the applicable Limit of Insurance on the
affected Covered Property.

If there is covered loss or damage to
Covered Property, not caused by "fun-
gus", wet or dry rot or bacteria, loss
payment will not be limited by the terms
of this Limited Coverage, except to the
extent that "fungus", wet or dry rot or
bacteria causes an increase in the loss.
Any such increase in the loss will be
subject to the terms of this Limited Cov-
erage.

(5) The terms of this Limited Coverage do
not increase or reduce the coverage
provided under Paragraph (2) of Cov-
ered Cause Of Loss k., Sprinkler Lea-
kage.

<!-- PageNumber="Page 10 of 17" -->
<!-- PageFooter="@ ISO Properties, Inc., 2007" -->
<!-- PageFooter="CP 00 99 06 07 ☐" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

For the purpose of this exclusion, electrical,
magnetic or electromagnetic energy in-
cludes but is not limited to:

(a) Electrical current, including arcing;

(b) Electrical charge produced or con-
ducted by a magnetic or electromag-
netic field;

b. Rupture or bursting of water pipes (other
than Automatic Sprinkler Systems if sprink-
ler leakage is a Covered Cause of Loss)
unless caused by a Covered Cause of
Loss.

c. Leakage or discharge of water or steam
from any part of a system or appliance con-
taining water or steam (other than an Au-
tomatic Sprinkler System if sprinkler lea-
kage is a Covered Cause of Loss), unless
the leakage or discharge occurs because
the system or appliance was damaged by a
Covered Cause of Loss. But we will not pay
for loss or damage caused by or resulting
from continuous or repeated seepage or
leakage of water, or the presence or con-
densation of humidity, moisture or vapor,
that occurs over a period of 14 days or
more.

d. Explosion of steam boilers, steam pipes,

Cause of Loss.

f. Neglect of an insured to use all reasonable
means to save and preserve property from
further damage at and after the time of loss.


## C. Limits Of Insurance

The most we will pay for loss or damage in any
one occurrence is the applicable Limit of Insur-
ance shown in the Declarations.

The most we will pay for loss or damage to out-
door signs, whether or not the sign is attached to a
building, is $2,500 per sign in any one occurrence.

The amounts of insurance stated in the following
Additional Coverages apply in accordance with the
terms of such coverages and are separate from
the Limit(s) of Insurance shown in the Declarations
for any other coverage:

1\. Fire Department Service Charge;

2\. Pollutant Clean-up And Removal; and

3\. Electronic Data.

Payments under the Preservation Of Property Ad-
ditional Coverage will not increase the applicable
Limit of Insurance.


## D. Deductible

In any one occurrence of loss or damage (herei-
nafter referred to as loss), we will first reduce the
amount of loss if required by the Coinsurance
Condition. If the adjusted amount of loss is less
than or equal to the Deductible, we will not pay for
that loss. If the adjusted amount of loss exceeds
the Deductible, we will then subtract the Deducti-
ble from the adjusted amount of loss, and will pay
the resulting amount or the Limit of Insurance,
whichever is less.

When the occurrence involves loss to more than
one item of Covered Property and separate Limits
of Insurance apply, the losses will not be com-
bined in determining application of the Deductible.
But the Deductible will be applied only once per
occurrence.


## EXAMPLE #1

(This example assumes there is no Coinsurance
penalty.)


<table>
<tr>
<td>Deductible:</td>
<td>$ 250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Limit of Insurance - Building #1:</td>
<td>$ 60,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Limit of Insurance - Building #2:</td>
<td>$ 80,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Loss to Building #1:</td>
<td>$ 60,100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Loss to Building #2:</td>
<td>$ 90,000</td>
</tr>
</table>


The amount of loss to Building #1 ($60,100) is less
than the sum ($60,250) of the Limit of Insurance ap-
plicable to Building #1 plus the Deductible.

The Deductible will be subtracted from the amount of
loss in calculating the loss payable for Building #1:

$ 60,100
\- 250

$ 59,850 Loss Payable - Building #1

The Deductible applies once per occurrence and
therefore is not subtracted in determining the amount
of loss payable for Building #2. Loss payable for
Building #2 is the Limit of Insurance of $80,000.

<!-- PageFooter="CP 00 99 06 07" -->
<!-- PageFooter="@ ISO Properties, Inc., 2007" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Page 11 of 17 ☐" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Total amount of loss payable:

$59,850 + $80,000 = $139,850

EXAMPLE #2

(This example, too, assumes there is no Coinsurance
penalty.)

The Deductible and Limits of Insurance are the same
as those in Example #1.

Loss to Building #1:

$ 70,000

(Exceeds Limit of Insurance plus Deductible)

Loss to Building #2:

$ 90,000

(Exceeds Limit of Insurance plus Deductible)

Loss Payable - Building #1:

$ 60,000

(Limit of Insurance)

Loss Payable - Building #2:

$ 80,000

(Limit of Insurance)

Total amount of loss payable:

$ 140,000

cient proof of notice.


## F. Other Common Policy Conditions


### 1. Changes

This policy contains all the agreements be-
tween you and us concerning the insurance af-
forded. The first Named Insured shown in the
Declarations is authorized to make changes in
the terms of this policy with our consent. This
policy's terms can be amended or waived only
by endorsement issued by us and made a part
of this policy.

2\. Examination Of Your Books And Records

We may examine and audit your books and
records as they relate to this policy at any time
during the policy period and up to three years
afterward.

3\. Inspections And Surveys

a. We have the right to:

(1) Make inspections and surveys at any
time;

(2) Give you reports on the conditions we
find; and

(3) Recommend changes.

b. We are not obligated to make any inspec-
tions, surveys, reports or recommendations
and any such actions we do undertake re-
late only to insurability and the premiums to
be charged. We do not make safety inspec-
tions. We do not undertake to perform the
duty of any person or organization to pro-
vide for the health or safety of workers or
the public. And we do not warrant that con-
ditions:

(1) Are safe or healthful; or

(2) Comply with laws, regulations, codes or

veys, reports or recommendations.

d. Paragraph b. of this condition does not
apply to any inspections, surveys, reports
or recommendations we may make relative
to certification, under state or municipal sta-
tutes, ordinances or regulations, of boilers,
pressure vessels or elevators.


## 4. Premiums

The first Named Insured shown in the Declara-
tions:

a. Is responsible for the payment of all pre-
miums; and

b. Will be the payee for any return premiums
we pay.


## 5. Transfer Of Your Rights And Duties Under This Policy

<!-- PageNumber="Page 12 of 17" -->
<!-- PageFooter="@ ISO Properties, Inc., 2007" -->
<!-- PageFooter="CP 00 99 06 07 ☐" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

If you die, your rights and duties will be trans-
ferred to your legal representative but only
while acting within the scope of duties as your
legal representative. Until your legal represent-
ative is appointed, anyone having proper tem-
porary custody of your property will have your
rights and duties but only with respect to that
property.


## G. Loss Conditions


### 1. Abandonment

There can be no abandonment of any property
to us.


### 2. Appraisal

If we and you disagree on the values of the
property or the amount of loss, either may
make written demand for an appraisal of the
loss. In this event, each party will select a
competent and impartial appraiser. The two
appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot
agree, either may request that selection be
made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.
The appraisers will state separately the value
of the property and amount of loss. If they fail
to agree, they will submit their differences to
the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two
will be binding. Each party will:

a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and

b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal
and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our
right to deny the claim.


### 3. Duties In The Event Of Loss Or Damage

a. You must see that the following are done in
the event of loss or damage to Covered
Property:

(1) Notify the police if a law may have been
broken.

(2) Give us prompt notice of the loss or
damage. Include a description of the
property involved.

(3) As soon as possible, give us a descrip-
tion of how, when and where the loss or
damage occurred.

(4) Take all reasonable steps to protect the
Covered Property from further damage,
and keep a record of your expenses ne-
cessary to protect the Covered Property,
for consideration in the settlement of the
claim. This will not increase the Limit of
Insurance. However, we will not pay for
any subsequent loss or damage result-
ing from a cause of loss that is not a
Covered Cause of Loss. Also, if feasi-
ble, set the damaged property aside and
in the best possible order for examina-
tion.

(5) At our request, give us complete inven-
tories of the damaged and undamaged
property. Include quantities, costs, val-
ues and amount of loss claimed.

(6) As often as may be reasonably required,
permit us to inspect the property proving
the loss or damage and examine your
books and records.

Also permit us to take samples of dam-
aged and undamaged property for in-
spection, testing and analysis, and per-
mit us to make copies from your books
and records.

(7) Send us a signed, sworn proof of loss
containing the information we request to
investigate the claim. You must do this
within 60 days after our request. We will
supply you with the necessary forms.

(8) Cooperate with us in the investigation or
settlement of the claim.

b. We may examine any insured under oath,
while not in the presence of any other in-
sured and at such times as may be reason-
ably required, about any matter relating to
this insurance or the claim, including an in-
sured's books and records. In the event of
an examination, an insured's answers must
be signed.

4\. Insurance Under Two Or More Coverages
If two or more of this policy's coverages apply
to the same loss or damage, we will not pay
more than the actual amount of the loss or
damage.

## 5. Loss Payment

a. In the event of loss or damage covered by
this policy, at our option, we will either:

(1) Pay the value of lost or damaged prop-
erty;

(2) Pay the cost of repairing or replacing the
lost or damaged property, subject to b.
below;

(3) Take all or any part of the property at an
agreed or appraised value; or

(4) Repair, rebuild or replace the property
with other property of like kind and quali-
ty, subject to b. below.

We will determine the value of lost or dam-
aged property, or the cost of its repair or
replacement, in accordance with the appli-
cable terms of the Valuation Condition in
this policy or any applicable provision which
amends or supersedes the Valuation Con-
dition.

b. The cost to repair, rebuild or replace does
not include the increased cost attributable
to enforcement of any ordinance or law re-
gulating the construction, use or repair of
any property.

c. We will give notice of our intentions within
30 days after we receive the sworn proof of
loss.

d. We will not pay you more than your finan-
cial interest in the Covered Property.

e. We may adjust losses with the owners of
lost or damaged property if other than you.
If we pay the owners, such payments will
satisfy your claims against us for the own-
ers' property. We will not pay the owners
more than their financial interest in the
Covered Property.

f. We may elect to defend you against suits
arising from claims of owners of property.
We will do this at our expense.

g. We will pay for covered loss or damage
within 30 days after we receive the sworn
proof of loss, if you have complied with all
of the terms of this Coverage Part and:

(1) We have reached agreement with you
on the amount of loss; or

(2) An appraisal award has been made.

h. A party wall is a wall that separates and is
common to adjoining buildings that are
owned by different parties. In settling cov-
ered losses involving a party wall, we will
pay a proportion of the loss to the party wall
based on your interest in the wall in propor-
tion to the interest of the owner of the ad-
joining building. However, if you elect to re-
pair or replace your building and the owner
of the adjoining building elects not to repair
or replace that building, we will pay you the
full value of the loss to the party wall, sub-
ject to all applicable policy provisions in-
cluding Limits of Insurance, the Valuation
and Coinsurance Conditions and all other
provisions of this Loss Payment Condition.
Our payment under the provisions of this
paragraph does not alter any right of subro-
gation we may have against any entity, in-
cluding the owner or insurer of the adjoining
building, and does not alter the terms of the
Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against
Others To Us Condition in this policy.


## 6. Other Insurance

a. You may have other insurance subject to
the same plan, terms, conditions and provi-
sions as the insurance under this policy. If
you do, we will pay our share of the cov-
ered loss or damage. Our share is the pro-
portion that the applicable Limit of Insur-
ance under this policy bears to the Limits of
Insurance of all covering on the same ba-
sis.

b. If there is other insurance covering the
same loss or damage, other than that de-
scribed in a. above, we will pay only for the
amount of covered loss or damage in
excess of the amount due from that other
insurance, whether you can collect on it or
not. But we will not pay more than the ap-
plicable Limit of Insurance.


## 7. Recovered Property

If either you or we recover any property after
loss settlement, that party must give the other
prompt notice. At your option, the property will
be returned to you. You must then return to us
the amount we paid to you for the property. We
will pay recovery expenses and the expenses
to repair the recovered property, subject to the
Limit of Insurance.

## 8. Vacancy


### a. Description Of Terms

(1) As used in this Vacancy Condition, the
term building has the meanings set forth
in (1)(a) and (1)(b) below:

(a) When this policy is issued to a te-
nant, and with respect to that te-
nant's interest in Covered Property,
building means the unit or suite
rented or leased to the tenant.

(b) When this policy is issued to the
owner or general lessee of a build-
ing, building means the entire build-
ing. Such building is "vacant" or "un-
occupied" when 70% or more of its
total square footage is "vacant" or
"unoccupied".

(2) Buildings under construction or renova-
tion are not considered "vacant" or "un-
occupied".


## b. Vacancy Provisions

We will not pay for any loss or damage if
the building where loss or damage occurs
has been "vacant" or "unoccupied" for more
than:

(1) 30 consecutive days before that loss or
damage if caused by Vandalism (if it is a
Covered Cause of Loss); or

(2) 60 consecutive days before that loss or
damage if caused by any other Covered
Cause of Loss;

whether or not such vacancy or unoccu-
pancy begins before the inception of this
policy.

But we will pay if the building is "unoccu-
pied" due to circumstances that are usual
or incidental to the described occupancy.

This condition does not apply if the Vacan-
cy Permit Endorsement is attached.


## 9. Valuation

We will determine the value of Covered Prop-
erty in the event of loss or damage as follows:

a. At actual cash value as of the time of loss
or damage, except as provided in b., c. and
d. below.

b. "Stock" you have sold but not delivered at
the selling price less discounts and ex-
penses you otherwise would have had.

c. Glass at the cost of replacement with safe-
ty-glazing material if required by law.

d. Tenants' Improvements and Betterments at:

(1) Actual cash value of the lost or dam-
aged property if you make repairs
promptly.

(2) A proportion of your original cost if you
do not make repairs promptly. We will
determine the proportionate value as fol-
lows:

(a) Multiply the original cost by the num-
ber of days from the loss or damage
to the expiration of the lease; and

(b) Divide the amount determined in (a)
above by the number of days from
the installation of improvements to
the expiration of the lease.

If your lease contains a renewal option,
the expiration of the renewal option pe-
riod will replace the expiration of the
lease in this procedure.

(3) Nothing if others pay for repairs or re-
placement.


## H. Additional Conditions


### 1. Coinsurance

If a Coinsurance percentage is shown in the
Declarations, the following condition applies.

We will not pay the full amount of any loss if
the value of Covered Property at the time of
loss times the Coinsurance percentage shown
for it in the Declarations is greater than the
Limit of Insurance for the property.

Instead, we will determine the most we will pay
using the following steps:

(1) Multiply the value of Covered Property
at the time of loss by the Coinsurance
percentage;

(2) Divide the Limit of Insurance of the
property by the figure determined in
Step (1);

(3) Multiply the total amount of loss, before
the application of any deductible, by the
figure determined in Step (2); and

(4) Subtract the deductible from the figure
determined in Step (3).

We will pay the amount determined in Step
(4) or the limit of insurance, whichever is
less. For the remainder, you will either have
to rely on other insurance or absorb the
loss yourself.

## EXAMPLE #1 (UNDERINSURANCE)

When:
The value of the property is:
The Coinsurance percentage

$ 250,000


<table>
<tr>
<th>for it is:</th>
<th>80%</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Limit of Insurance for it is:</td>
<td>$ 100,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Deductible is:</td>
<td>$ 250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The amount of loss is:</td>
<td>$ 40,000</td>
</tr>
</table>


Step (1): $250,000 × 80% = $200,000
(the minimum amount of insurance to
meet your Coinsurance requirements)
Step (2): $100,000 + $200,000 = . 50

Step (3): $40,000 x .50 = $20,000

Step (4): $20,000 - $250 = $19,750
We will pay no more than $19,750. The remaining
$20,250 is not covered.


## EXAMPLE #2 (ADEQUATE INSURANCE)

When:


<table>
<tr>
<td>The value of the property is:</td>
<td>$ 250,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Coinsurance percentage</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>for it is:</td>
<td>80%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Limit of Insurance for it is:</td>
<td>$ 200,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Deductible is:</td>
<td>$ 250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The amount of loss is:</td>
<td>$ 40,000</td>
</tr>
</table>


The minimum amount of insurance to meet your
Coinsurance requirement is $200,000 ($250,000 x
80%). Therefore, the Limit of Insurance in this exam-
ple is adequate and no penalty applies. We will pay
no more than $39,750 ($40,000 amount of loss minus
the deductible of $250).


## 2. Concealment, Misrepresentation Or Fraud

also void if you or any other insured, at any
time, intentionally conceals or misrepresents a
material fact concerning:

a. This policy;

## 3. Control Of Property

Any act or neglect of any person other than
you beyond your direction or control will not af-
fect this insurance.

any one or more locations will not affect cover-
age at any location where, at the time of loss,
the breach of condition does not exist.


## 4. Knowledge Or Control

chance of loss or damage is increased by any
means within your knowledge or control.

der this policy unless:

a. There has been full compliance with all of
the terms of this policy; and

b. The action is brought within two years after
the date on which the direct physical loss or
damage occurred.


## 6. Liberalization

mediately apply to this policy.

b. We will pay for covered loss of or damage
to buildings or structures to each mort-
gageholder shown in the Declarations in
their order of precedence, as interests may
appear.

has started foreclosure or similar action on
the building or structure.

d. If we deny your claim because of your acts
or because you have failed to comply with
the terms of this policy, the mortgageholder
will still have the right to receive loss pay-
ment if the mortgageholder:

(1) Pays any premium due under this policy
at our request if you have failed to do
so;

(2) Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss
within 60 days after receiving notice
from us of your failure to do so; and

mortgage will be transferred to us to the
extent of the amount we pay; and

(2) The mortgageholder's right to recover
the full amount of the mortgageholder's
claim will not be impaired.

At our option, we may pay to the mortgage-
holder the whole principal on the mortgage
plus any accrued interest. In this event,
your mortgage and note will be transferred

gage debt to us.

## 10. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us

make payment under this policy has rights to
recover damages from another, those rights
are transferred to us to the extent of our pay-
ment. That person or organization must do
everything necessary to secure our rights and
must do nothing after loss to impair them. But
you may waive your rights against another par-
ty in writing:

a. Prior to a loss to your Covered Property.

lowing:
